Genode component code for managing synchronization.

This component uses the RQ manager shared memory, data structure(Created by Paul) inorder to access the next thread to be executed. 

Once the Shared array has a thread to be executed, this component accesses the thread and adds that in to the corresponding ready queue of the Processor.
The access control is synchronized with mutual exclusion between the components. 

Accessing the ready queue
============================
As of now the ready queue can not be accessed directly from this component, so a call is made to the scheduler(or a custom) kernel object with the corresponding thread id, which then deploys
the thread on to the ready queue.
